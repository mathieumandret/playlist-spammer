# Playlist spammer

Small and dumb script to add the same song to a Spotify playlist multiple times, written in Clojure because why not.

Could definitely be a single curl command but it would boring to use the appropriate software

To improve:

* Nested let binding
* ~~Split CLI/Spotify client~~
* Nicely format output

Used for my best playlist so far: https://open.spotify.com/playlist/3ysl0PdLZ3A6t05Hqz2REh?si=A6gm6foVS7u28ImyfZ67bg

Project created with [Leiningen](https://leiningen.org)
